## Introduction

सङ्ग्रह is a portal to digitize and archive literary works from Nepal and make them accessible online through a user-friendly searchable interface to readers all around the world.

Recognizing the lack of an easy access to Nepali literary works in the internet, the सङ्ग्रह project started as an initiative to create an online repository that gathers literary works from Nepal in Nepali and other indigenous languages. The aim is to use digital technology to place Nepali literature before the widest possible audience and raise it to a more visible and influential position in Nepali culture. The objectives of सङ्ग्रह project are:

- Digitize literatures of Nepal in Nepali and non-Nepali languages by established as well as emerging writers
- Create a platform where readers and enthusiasts of literature can browse, search and find relevant content with a customized powerful search facility
- Provide tools and resources for students and readers of literature to learn about different literary cultures of Nepal
- Maintain a free content, open source environment where users can edit the available content and upload new content

The सङ्ग्रह website will be equipped with the following features:

- Full text search
- Facility to browse by different categories such as themes, genre, poets, periods, literary movements, languages, region, etc
- Interactive content designed to explore and learn more about the literature and the authors
- Links to related media - audio, video, art, and web resources
- Side-by-side translations of texts in different languages
- A dictionary, especially for materials in non Nepali languages so that they are accessible to all Nepali speakers
